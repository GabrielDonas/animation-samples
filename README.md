# Animation Samples

### ðŸŽž [Live Demo]()

A single-page application to showcase SVG animations and interact with them.
The animations were created in After Effects, exported with the [Bodymovin plugin](https://exchange.adobe.com/creativecloud.details.12557.bodymovin.html), and rendered natively with [Lottie](https://airbnb.io/lottie/#/).

Components built with [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) library.
